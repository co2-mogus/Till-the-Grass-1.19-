# Till-the-Grass-1.19-

Adds various features from Java Edition Beta and Indev related to farming. These include:
1. The chance to produce seeds when tilling grass
2. When stepped on by players and most other entities, farmland is trampled, thus turning into dirt.
3. Villagers are exempt from this to allow farmers to function as normal.
4. Trampling can be prevented by placing fences, fence-gates, or walls one block beneath the farmland.
